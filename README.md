### Hook based tasks
Task 1: Create a Form Validation Component

1. Create a new React component called `FormValidation`.
2. Use the `useState` hook to initialize state variables for the form inputs (e.g., `name`, `email`, `password`).
3. Render an HTML form with input fields for name, email, and password.
4. Use the `useEffect` hook to add validation logic for the form inputs (e.g., validate email format, password length).
5. Display error messages for each input field if the validation fails.
6. Handle form submission and display a success message if all inputs are valid.

Task 2: Create a Fetch Data Component

1. Create a new React component called `FetchData`.
2. Use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from an API endpoint when the component mounts.
3. Store the fetched data in a state variable using the `useState` hook.
4. Render the fetched data in the component's JSX.
5. Handle any loading or error states while fetching the data.

Task 3: Create a Debounced Search Component

1. Create a new React component called `DebouncedSearch`.
2. Use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the search input value.
3. Use the `useEffect` hook with a debounce function to delay the execution of a search API call when the input value changes.
4. Render the search input field and display the search results below it.
5. Update the search results in real-time as the user types, but only perform the API call after a brief delay to avoid unnecessary requests.

These tasks should give you a good starting point to practice different React hooks and their use cases. Feel free to modify and enhance the tasks based on your learning goals and preferences.

Task 4: Student Management System

Create a Student Management System where you can add, update, and display student information using React's `useContext` hook.

1. Create a `StudentContext` using `createContext()` to store the student data.
2. Create a form component (`StudentForm`) to capture the student's name, age, and grade.
3. Implement a submit handler in `StudentForm` that adds the student to the student list in the context using the `useState` hook.
4. Create a component (`StudentList`) that displays a list of all students using the `useContext` hook to access the student data from the context.
5. Implement an update handler in `StudentList` that allows editing student information and updating the context.
6. Display the `StudentForm` and `StudentList` components in the main app component.
7. Style the components with CSS as desired.

This task demonstrates how to use `useContext` to manage state and share data between components in a student management system. By adding students through the form and updating them in the list, you can effectively manage the student data using the React Context API.

Note: To complete this task, you need to have a basic understanding of React, including `useState`, `useContext`, and component rendering.

Task 5: Calculation Memoization

Implement a calculation memoization task using React's `useMemo` hook. The goal is to optimize the performance of repetitive calculations by memoizing the results.

1. Create a component that takes two input numbers as props.
2. Inside the component, define a memoized function using `useMemo` that calculates the sum of the two input numbers.
3. Display the calculated sum in the component's render output.
4. Test the component by passing different input numbers and observing the calculated sum. Ensure that the calculation is only performed when the input numbers change.

This task demonstrates the use of `useMemo` to memoize the calculation result. By memoizing the calculation, the result is stored and only recalculated if the input numbers change. This optimization can significantly improve the performance of expensive calculations, especially in scenarios where the calculations are repeated frequently or involve complex operations.

Note: This task assumes basic familiarity with React and the `useMemo` hook.
