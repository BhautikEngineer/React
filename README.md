Counter using hooks

Make counter using usestate and useeffect for doubling it.


### Hook based tasks
Task 1: Create a Form Validation Component

1. Create a new React component called `FormValidation`.
2. Use the `useState` hook to initialize state variables for the form inputs (e.g., `name`, `email`, `password`).
3. Render an HTML form with input fields for name, email, and password.
4. Use the `useEffect` hook to add validation logic for the form inputs (e.g., validate email format, password length).
5. Display error messages for each input field if the validation fails.
6. Handle form submission and display a success message if all inputs are valid.

Task 2: Create a Fetch Data Component

1. Create a new React component called `FetchData`.
2. Use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from an API endpoint when the component mounts.
3. Store the fetched data in a state variable using the `useState` hook.
4. Render the fetched data in the component's JSX.
5. Handle any loading or error states while fetching the data.

Task 3: Create a Debounced Search Component

1. Create a new React component called `DebouncedSearch`.
2. Use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the search input value.
3. Use the `useEffect` hook with a debounce function to delay the execution of a search API call when the input value changes.
4. Render the search input field and display the search results below it.
5. Update the search results in real-time as the user types, but only perform the API call after a brief delay to avoid unnecessary requests.

These tasks should give you a good starting point to practice different React hooks and their use cases. Feel free to modify and enhance the tasks based on your learning goals and preferences.
